This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects and how to use them.

It is intended to use as a second project after "shapes". "shapes" is a 
subset of this project, that uses the individual shapes to illustrate
some characteristics of objects.

Here, more concepts are introduced through the "Picture" class:

 - objects can create other objects
 - sequential execution of statements in a method
 - objects can hold references to other objects

The project is intended for experimentation with modifying the source
code. Thus, it also demonstrates

 - classes have source code
 - the class source defines the object structure and behaviour
 - the edit/compile/execute cycle
 - the source can be changed to modify an application
